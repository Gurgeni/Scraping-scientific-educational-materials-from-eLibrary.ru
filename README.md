# Scraping-scientific-educational-materials-from-eLibrary.ru
eLibrary.ru is huge russian database (of scientific/educational materials) with lot of bugs, and security complications(at step 2).  
you can configure script to use zenrows  scraperbee for proxyrotation,js rendering and geo targeting.  

Here are the recommended steps for utilizing the Scraper:

1) Filtering Publications and Generating Link Addresses: Begin by applying filters to narrow down the desired publications based on specific criteria. This process involves selecting relevant categories, subjects, or other parameters to refine the search. Once the filters are set, the script will generate the corresponding link addresses for the identified publications.

2) Downloading HTMLs: After obtaining the link addresses, the script will initiate the downloading process to retrieve the HTML content of the selected publications. This step might encounter challenges due to the aforementioned bugs and security complications on eLibrary.ru. To overcome these issues, the Scraper can utilize ZenRows' features, such as proxy rotation, to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the downloading process. Additionally, JavaScript rendering can be employed to handle any dynamically loaded content on the website.

3) Parsing HTMLs: Once the HTML content is obtained, the script will parse the downloaded files to extract the desired information. This involves using appropriate parsing techniques, such as leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy in Python, to navigate the HTML structure and extract relevant data elements, such as titles, authors, abstracts, or full-text content. By parsing the HTMLs, the script enables further analysis and manipulation of the scraped scientific materials.
